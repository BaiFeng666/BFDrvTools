## Feature
* Exclusive undisclosed kernel hook communication mode Regardless of speed and concealment, it is far faster than conventional IO communication!
* Seamless mapping + cloud-issued decryption call, super shrink-headed tortoise
* Multiple kernel injections spike all games on the market for EAC, BE, and EAC
Contains five powerful and rich read and write modes: Ke, Mdl, Mm, Phy, FuckCr3
* Each has its own characteristics, but it's not too much to introduce. There are detailed functional comments in the example.
* In pursuit of stability, you can use FuckCr3 or Phy mode
FuckCr3 can read and write games protected by EAC encrypted cr3, such as Apex, without affecting the speed
* Get the base address and size of the module
* Get module export function
* Mouse movement, click, bounce, press
* Keyboard simulation, click, bounce, press
The kernel disables the global enumeration window
* Anti-screenshot of the window: customizable transparent and black
* Kernel-level protection, anti-debugging: prevent CE, OD and other debugging tools from attaching processes
* Kernel-level hidden processes: processes disappear directly in the task manager
* Forcibly delete files
* Four signature positioning search algorithms
* Memory query
* Dump any process module to a file
* There is a complete call example of C++
* It is prohibited to use for any illegal purpose
